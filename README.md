## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I learned to work with nullish coalescing operator which is a great feature.

```js
document.querySelector("#rating").innerHTML = rating ?? 0;
```


### Useful resources

- [Nullish Coalescing Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator) - I really liked this feature and will use it going forward.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This is an amazing website which helped me review my flexbox skills. I'd recommend it to anyone because it is an interactive game to practice flexbox.
